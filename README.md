# Levitate Board

Levitate Board is a minimalist interactive web experiment built using **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**.  
It presents a grid of squares that react to cursor movement with smooth color and glow effects, creating a subtle “levitating” visual experience.

The project focuses on simplicity, clean structure, and intentional interaction rather than heavy visuals or external libraries.

## 🎯 Project Objective

The purpose of this project is to:

- Practice DOM manipulation using vanilla JavaScript
- Understand CSS Flexbox layout behavior
- Explore hover-based UI interactions
- Build a visually clean and minimal interface
- Write simple, readable, and maintainable frontend code

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

- JavaScript dynamically generates a grid of square elements
- Each square listens for mouse hover events
- On hover:
  - A random color is applied
  - A glowing box-shadow effect is added
- On mouse leave:
  - The square returns to its default appearance

## 🔮 Possible Enhancements

- Make the grid size fully responsive to different screen sizes
- Add ripple or wave effects between neighboring squares
- Convert the grid to `<canvas>` for performance experimentation
- Add keyboard and touch-based interactions for accessibility
